# twittertools

This is a set of Twitter scripts and utilities.

* twfriend.py - Compares your following and followers and produces 3 lists:

 * mutual followers
 * users you're following but aren't following you back
 * followers you aren't following back
 
* twlistdump.py - Prints out all the members of a list.

* twlistcheck.py - Checks a list for protected users whom you aren't following. Optionally, remove those users from the list. (because you won't see their tweets in the list timeline anyway)

* twnotifs.py - Prints out users for whom you have phone notifications turned on.

* twretweet.py - Prints out users for whom you have turned off retweets.
